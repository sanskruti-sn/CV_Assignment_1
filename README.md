To solve this problem, we used a combination of tools and libraries:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Downloads a YouTube video using yt-dlp.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Processes the video frame by frame using OpenCV.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Annotates each frame with labels like Night, Dawn, or Morning, based on brightness thresholds.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Generates an annotated video that adjusts playback speed and resolution.

üíª Tools Used: [Python, OpenCV, yt-dlp]
